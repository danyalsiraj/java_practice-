##What is this repo about?

In this repo you will see different challenges I have solved using Java, this includes problems from where I first started programming to solving different data structures studied in University, hacker rank challenges, and other fun problems.

Most of my code is tested using JUnit.

##Some things you will find

- [Data Structures](https://github.com/danyalsiraj/java_practice-/tree/master/examples/src/collections) and [test cases](https://github.com/danyalsiraj/java_practice-/tree/master/examples/src/Test/collections). This includes Stacks, Queues, Heaps, Linked Lists, Binary Trees, AVL Balanced binary trees, 2-4 Trees.
- [Coding Challenges](https://github.com/danyalsiraj/java_practice-/tree/master/examples/src/examples) and [test cases](https://github.com/danyalsiraj/java_practice-/tree/master/examples/src/Test/examples) of some of them. Didn't write test cases for a lot of them as they were solved on hacker rank so already aggresively tested on the correct solutions and time complexities.
- [LAN Client Server app](https://github.com/danyalsiraj/java_practice-/tree/master/examples/src/simplechat1)
- You will also find other problems I solved, such as basketball player program, threads, practicing OOP, etc.
